Human Verification

This is a human verification application I created using C# and Windows Forms. It uses a puzzle to verify whether the user is a real person or a bot. It was just a simple application I did to understand the situation. I'm not currently interested in its website integrations.

How to use

To use the human verification app, just click the "Start" button. The app will then display a puzzle with a missing piece. You need to drag the piece to the correct position.

If you place the piece in the correct place, the application will display a "Success" message. If you place the part in the wrong place, the app will display a "Wrong location" message.

Possible improvements

A more challenging puzzle: The current puzzle is relatively easy to solve. More security features can be added to the puzzle to make it harder for bots to solve.
